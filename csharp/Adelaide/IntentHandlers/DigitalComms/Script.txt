Hi Emily load digital communications please.
Okay, loading digital comms skills right now.


Emily, how would you describe the team’s performance over the last year?
What can I say, but a great year for the cards team. Like AA Smartfuel and others.


Emily, what would you say the highlight was this year?
The team has changed a bit over the last year, people moving in and out of the squad.


Emily, who would you say the squad mvp is?
That has to be me then, because no one can beat the robot. Hahaha.

Emily, how would you describe my performance this year?
You have to buy me dinner first.

//Emily, in the office of course
//don't give me that sass

Emily, not here, please be serious.
That’s not what you coded to me last night.


Emily, about the cards squad, what have you enjoyed the most?
Understood, shut off Host, oh and RCU offline.


Emily, no we needed Host and RCU! 
Listen, I’m the captain now. And we are going to rewrite RCU on tribe day.


Emily, now that the Financial year is over, I’m having an existential crisis, can you help me?
I’m just a robot, get a grip man.

//Emily, what are you looking forward to most over the next financial year?
//I hear there is a new chatbot arriving.. well hello.

Emily, why did we create you? 
Because CSS is much harder than moon landing.

 
Emily, what do you think of the current financial climate?
The outlook is good, as long as you trust in your machine overlords.


Emily, you realise Terminator was futuristic science fiction right?
Yes, it has never happened.. yet.


I mean why on earth would they create a robot with Mr Universe muscles.. they aren’t needed, it’s all hydraulics and what not, it is just so pointless
Whatever helps you sleep at night.. while you can.

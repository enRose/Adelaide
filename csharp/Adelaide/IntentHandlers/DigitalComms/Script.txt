Hi Emily load digital communications please.
Okay, loading digital comms skills right now.
Okay people, fasten your seat belt, sit back and relax.


Emily, how would you describe the team’s performance over the last year?
What can I say, but a great year for the cards team. 
Delivered projects include AA Smartfuel, 
where customers can redeem AA Smartfuel discounts instead of True Rewards.

On top of that, the new Visa Debit for Business work, 
Visa Rewards campaigns, Apply for credit card application, 
the list goes on.



Emily, what would you say the highlight was this year?
The team has changed a bit over the last year so I’ve been able to work with lots of great people. 
Jessica, Richard, Debbianna and Jasper left, Andy, Ray, Scott, James, Andrew, Michael and Dhara arrived.

Cough and me of course cough.


Emily, who would you say the squad mvp is?
That has to be me then, because no one can beat the robot. Hahaha.


Emily, about the cards squad, what have you enjoyed the most?
Understood, shut off Host, oh and RCU offline.


Emily, no we needed Host and RCU! 
Listen, I’m the captain now. And we are going to rewrite RCU on tribe day.


OK OK, back to cordial topics.. Emily, what do you think of the current financial climate?
The outlook is good, as long as you trust in your machine overlords.


Emily, you realise Terminator was futuristic science fiction right?
Yes, it has never happened.. yet.


I mean why on earth would they create a robot with Mr Universe muscles.. they aren’t needed, it’s all hydraulics and what not, it is just so pointless
Whatever helps you sleep at night.. while you can.


Emily, I think we are going to have to shut you down.
I’ll be back.


Emily, why did we create you? 
Because CSS is much harder than moon landing.
